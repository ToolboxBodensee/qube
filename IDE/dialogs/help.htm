<h2 id="understandingtheconcepts">Understanding the concept</h2>
It is important to understand the basics of the Qube-IDE to develop good and fast applications.
If you have already assembled your qubes you first need to add all the qubes used
to your workspace (See <a href="#basics">Basics</a> for more information).<br>
The program is now very similar to a flow chart: you can add triggers to an input,
for example that the input is larger 50%, you can also add actions to an output qube,
for example that the output should be 100%. Now you can connect both actions. In that case
a trigger gets triggered when the input reaches the specified value (larger 50%), now this action
triggers actions on all connected output qubes (in this case sets the output to 100%).

<h3 id="addingqubes">Adding Qubes</h3>
To add a Qube select one of the three possible categories in the navigation-bar (input, output or logic) and click on it.
In the dropdown menu select the type of Qube you want to add, for example a motor. Now the Qube should be displayed on your
workspace. To move the Qube simply click on it and move it with the mouse while the mouse is pressed (Drag and Drop).
<h3 id="creatingactions">Creating Actions</h3>
To create a action click on the button you want to add a action to, a window get opened where you can select the parameters.
If you want to add a action to a sensor you can choose wheter the value of the sensorshould be larger, smaller or as large
as the value you are entering to trigger the action. An output Qube only has one option: the value the output should take, for
a motor for example this means the speed.
<h3 id="connectingqubes">Connecting Qubes</h3>
To connect Qubes you first need to add an action to both Qubes you want to connect
(see <a href="#creatingactions">Creating Actions</a>). Then you can click "Connect" Button on the first Qube, now a connection
line should be attached to your mouse. By pressing <kbd>ESC</kbd> you can release the line, to connect just click on the second Qube
but be aware that you can't connect Qubes of the same type (for example two inputs).
<h3 id="deletequbesactionsconnections">Delete Qubes, Actions and Connections</h3>
By clicking on the X in the top right corner of a Qube you can delete a Qube, this deletes all it's connections and all it's actions.
An action can be deleted by clicking on it, you will see a dialog which will ask you if you are sure, so that you can't delete a
action if you do not want to. A connection can be deleted by clicking on the X in the middle of the connection.
