<h2 id="understandingtheconcepts">Understanding the concept</h2>
It is important to understand the basics of the Qube-IDE to develop good and fast applications.
If you have already assembled your qubes you first need to add all the qubes used
to your workspace (See <a href="#basics">Basics</a> for more information).<br>
The program is now very similar to a flow chart: you can add triggers to an input,
for example that the input is larger 50%, you can also add actions to an output qube,
for example that the output should be 100%. Now you can connect both actions. In that case
a trigger gets triggered when the input reaches the specified value (larger 50%), now this action
triggers actions on all connected output qubes (in this case sets the output to 100%).
