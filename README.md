# Qube
Qube is an easy-to-use modular microcontroller system. Sensors and actuators can be connected to a main cube ("Main Qube"). All cubes ("Qubes") are connected to the Main Qube, which can be programmed. Qube is aimed at beginners, since no electronic knowledge is required. The graphical programming environment is beginner friendly and runs in the web browser. Our project is completely open source, detailed documentation makes it easier to develop new Qubes.
